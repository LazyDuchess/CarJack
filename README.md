Cruise through New Amsterdam like never before.

## Usage
A new `carjack` app will be available on your phone. Use it to access this mod's features.

## Controls
Below are the controls, their default bindings for both Keyboard + Mouse and Controller and their corresponding inputs in the in-game `Settings -> Input` Menu.

### Air Control
On Controller, the left stick lets you adjust the pitch and yaw of your vehicle. Holding handbrake will let you adjust the roll of your car rather than the yaw.

On Keyboard + Mouse, the steering keys let you adjust the yaw of your vehicle. Holding handbrake lets you adjust the pitch with the accelerate and reverse keys and the roll with the steering keys.

## Dependencies
If you're using a mod manager such as r2modman dependencies are automatically installed for you.
